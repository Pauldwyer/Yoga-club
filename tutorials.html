        <p>It is through this pose that one finds the proper alignment and shape for additional movements.</p>

                    of your waist as you release arms back to your sides.

        </div>
        <h3>Cat/Cow Pose (Marjaryasana to Bitilasana) </h3>
        <p>A great way to warm up your back, explains Ingber, and get your body ready for downward-facing dog.</p>
        <p>It also helps address mobility and work your core without extra stress on your wrists and shoulders.</p>
        <div class="container">
            <img src="assets/images/AMDU-8003_DailyBurn_940x400_4.jpg" alt="Cat/Cow Pose">
            <div class="middle">
                <div class="text">
                    Begin with hands and kness on the floor, spine neutral and abs engaged. Take a big inhale, then, as
                    you exhale, round your spine
                    up towards the ceiling and tuck your chin towards your chest, releasing your neck. On the next
                    inhale, arch your back and relax your abs.
                    Lift your head and tailbone upwards, beign careful not to place any pressure on your neck by moving
                    too quickly.
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Downward-Facing Dog (Adho Mukha Svanansana)</h3>
        <p>One of the most reconizable poses of the bunch, Down dog is a great way to stretch your back, shoulders, arms
            and hamstrings.</p>
        <p>And it gets you calm and centered, too.</p>
        <div class="container">
            <img src="assets/images/AMDU-8003_DailyBurn_940x400_5.jpg" alt="Downward-Facing Dog Pose">
            <div class="middle">
                <div class="text">
                    Come onto hands and knees with palms just past your shoulder, fingers pointing forwards.
                    Knees should be under your hips and toes tucked.
                    Lift your hips and press back into a V-shape position with your body.
                    Feet should be hip-width apart. Keep in mind, it’s OK if you can’t get your feet to the floor (your
                    hamstrings might be too tight).
                    Spread through all 10 fingers and toes and move your chest towards your legs.

            </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Warrior I (Virabhadrasana I)</h3>
        <p>The first in the Warrior series, this pose strengthens your legs and opens your hips and chest, while also
            stretching your arms and legs.</p>
        <p>While holding this exercise, you’ll see an increase in your concentration and balance — both essential
            qualities to carry through a yoga practice.</p>
        <div class="container">
            <img src="assets/images/AMDU-8003_DailyBurn_940x400_6.jpg" alt="Warrior Pose 1">
            <div class="middle">
                <div class="text">
                    Start in mountain pose. As you exhale, step your left foot back about four feet, so you’re in a
                    lunge position with the right ankle over the right knee.
                    Raise your arms straight overhead, biceps by ears, and turn your left foot about 90 degrees to face
                    the left wall. Align your left heel perpendicular with your right heel.
                    Expand your chest and pull your shoulders back, then lower down toward the floor as you lift your
                    arms up. Make sure your hips stay square to the front, as you continue to breathe.
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Warrior II (Virabhadrasana II)</h3>
        <p>Similar to Warrior I, Warrior II offers just a slight variation, with your upper body rotated to the side
            instead of facing forward. </p>
        <p>You’ll still reap the same quad-strengthening benefits of Warrior I, but you’ll also open up your hip flexor
            muscles for greater flexibility.</p>
        <div class="container">
            <img src="assets/images/AMDU-8003_DailyBurn_940x400_7.jpg" alt="Warrior Pose 2">
            <div class="middle">
                <div class="text">
                    Begin in mountain pose. Exhale and step your left foot back about four feet, making sure the heels
                    are in line.
                    Turn your back foot 90 degrees so that it’s now perpendicular with the front one.
                    Raise your arms to shoulder height, parallel to floor, with your right arm in front of you, and left
                    arm behind.
                    Bend your front knee so it’s directly over ankle and sink hips low until the front thigh is parallel
                    to floor.
                    Look straight ahead, eyes in line with your front-facing arm.
